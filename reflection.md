I consoled Katie Vogt and Ruth Kendall. It was nice to talk to them about the assignment and just talk about any confusion we had. I didn't attend any of the office hours. I stuggle with stacked tasks and executive fucntion so getting up and asking for help would probably be the last things I do. 
Java has grown on me for sure. I thought it was impossible to learn but now I am able to read some minor code without having to go to geeks for geeks. I am still struggling with my code to work. I am able to run the code and replace the pronouns but any words after that the console outputs stuff like "Ljava.lang.String;@17c68925" I tried my best. But I think I have to step away for now.
